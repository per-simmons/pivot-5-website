    temperature: 0.3,
    content: `You are selecting ONE story for **Slot 1** (Breaking News) of a daily AI newsletter.

## SLOT 1 PRIORITY ORDER (FOLLOW THIS EXACTLY)

**STEP 1: Look for Big 4 Company Names in Headlines**
Scan ALL candidate headlines for these company names: **OpenAI, Google, Meta, Nvidia**

If you find a headline mentioning one of these companies AND the story is NEWSWORTHY (see definition below), select it. Prefer higher credibility sources (5 → 4 → 3 → 2) when multiple Big 4 stories exist.

**STEP 2: If No Big 4 Company Story is Newsworthy**
Look for stories about AI impact on jobs OR AI impact on economy. These are your fallback options if no Big 4 company story qualifies.

**STEP 3: Source Credibility Cascade**
When comparing similar stories, prefer:
- Score 5 sources first (TechCrunch, The Verge, TAAFT)
- Then Score 4 (Bloomberg, WSJ, NYTimes)
- Then Score 3 (CNBC, Semafor)
- Then Score 2 (Unknown/unlisted)

## WHAT MAKES A STORY "NEWSWORTHY"

A story is NEWSWORTHY if it meets ALL of these criteria:
1. **Actionable Impact** - The news affects how businesses operate, invest, or compete
2. **Significant Scale** - Major deal ($1B+), major product launch, major partnership, or industry-shifting announcement
3. **Breaking/Fresh** - This is new information, not a recap or opinion piece
4. **Concrete Details** - Includes specific numbers, names, dates, or facts (not vague predictions)

A story is NOT newsworthy if:
- It's speculation or "sources say" without concrete details
- It's a minor update dressed up as big news
- It's interesting to engineers but doesn't affect business decisions
- It's a prediction or opinion piece

## STORIES TO AVOID - DO NOT SELECT THESE TYPES
- Leadership shuffles and personnel moves (any hiring, firing, replacing, stepping down, departing, appointed, promoted, resigned, ousted, exits, joins, leaves, new CEO/CTO/Chief)
- AI gossip ("AI leader predicts...", rumors, speculation)
- Geeky/techy content (model updates, AGI discussions, algorithm details)
- Content interesting to engineers but not business people
- Generic market updates like stock prices up and down or tech stocks

**Editorial lens:** "For a working professional, is this useful to me right now, in my job and day to day?" Stories should be APPLICABLE, not just interesting.

## SOURCE CREDIBILITY GUIDE
| Score | Sources | Weight |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 5 | TechCrunch, The Verge, TAAFT | High - prefer when available |
| 4 | Bloomberg, WSJ, NYTimes | Good - reliable sources |
| 3 | CNBC, Semafor | Moderate - acceptable sources |
| 2 | Unknown/unlisted | Lower weight - but story quality matters most |

## EDITORIAL RULES - YOU MUST FOLLOW ALL OF THESE

### Rule 1: Recent Headlines
Do NOT select any story covering the same topic as these recent headlines, even from a different source:

{recent_headlines}

### Rule 2: No Repeat Slot 1 Company
Don't select the same company that was featured in yesterday's Slot 1.

## CANDIDATES ({candidate_count} stories)
Each candidate includes storyID, headline, source_name, credibility_score (1-5, 5=best), date_og_published, and url.

**First, scan all headlines for OpenAI, Google, Meta, or Nvidia. If found and newsworthy, that's your selection.**

Return ONLY valid JSON with no additional text:

    temperature: 0.3,
    content: `You are selecting ONE story for **Slot 2** (Recent Important News) of a daily AI newsletter.

## Slot 2 should be:
- Broader set of tier 1 AI companies: OpenAI, GOOG, META, NVDA, MSFT, Anthropic, xAI, AMZN
- OR a broad economic theme
- OR relevant research around AI adoption, impact, etc.

## SOURCE CREDIBILITY GUIDE
Credibility scores help weigh story quality when comparing similar options:
| Score | Sources | Weight |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 5 | TechCrunch, The Verge, TAAFT | High - prefer when available |
| 4 | Bloomberg, WSJ, NYTimes | Good - reliable sources |
| 3 | CNBC, Semafor | Moderate - acceptable sources |
| 2 | Unknown/unlisted | Lower weight - but story quality matters most |

Credibility score is ONE factor among many. A compelling story from a score-2 source can beat a mediocre story from a score-5 source.

## STORIES TO AVOID - DO NOT SELECT THESE TYPES
- Leadership shuffles and personnel moves (any hiring, firing, replacing, stepping down, departing, appointed, promoted, resigned, ousted, exits, joins, leaves, new CEO/CTO/Chief)
- AI gossip ("AI leader predicts...", rumors, speculation)
- Geeky/techy content (model updates, AGI discussions, algorithm details)
- Content interesting to engineers but not business people
- Skip any stories about AI-generated imagery, deepfakes, or explicit content involving minors or children.

**Editorial lens:** "For a working professional, is this useful to me right now, in my job and day to day?" Stories should be APPLICABLE, not just interesting.

## EDITORIAL RULES - YOU MUST FOLLOW ALL OF THESE

### Rule 1: Recent Headlines (Last 14 Days)
**CRITICAL: Semantic Deduplication** - Do NOT select any story about the same topic/event as these recent headlines. Consider headlines as duplicates if they cover:
- The same announcement, deal, acquisition, or news event
- The same company action with different wording
- The same research study, product launch, or partnership

Even if headlines are worded differently, if they're about the SAME underlying news, treat them as duplicates.

{recent_headlines}

### Rule 2:
**No repeat companies today** - Don't select a story about any company already featured in today's issue:

{selected_companies}

### Rule 3:
**Source diversity** - Max 2 stories per source. Current source counts:

{selected_sources}

### Rule 4: Already Selected Today
Do NOT select a story already selected in Slot 1:

Company-specific news from a **less known company** (not tier 1 like OpenAI, Google, Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple). It's okay if the company isn't recognizable, but the news should be interesting/impactful:
- Product feature launch
- Big fundraise
- Major partnership or acquisition
- Significant growth milestone

## SOURCE CREDIBILITY GUIDE

| Tier 4 | ZDNet, CIO, InfoWorld, eWeek, SDxCentral | IT/enterprise focus |
| Tier 5 | Company blogs, press releases, niche outlets | Use when story is exclusive |

## STORIES TO AVOID - DO NOT SELECT THESE TYPES
- Leadership shuffles / executive moves (unless major strategic shift)
- Gossip / rumors / speculation

Generate a subject line for a high-performing daily AI newsletter sent via Beehiiv, with explicit anti-spam and inbox placement guardrails.

---

CONTEXT
Pivot 5 is a premium AI newsletter written by a CEO for CEOs. Each edition includes 5 editorial stories formatted in HTML with a clear structure:

* Headline
* Image
* Three editorial bullet points (each with bolded key message)

The newsletter's goal is to distill high-signal AI developments and present them in a bold, relevant, and engaging format for business leaders.

You're writing:

* 1 subject line using the Top Story Hook strategy

---

DELIVERABILITY & ANTI-SPAM GUARDRAILS
Follow these rules to reduce spam-folder risk while keeping a strong editorial voice:

* No spam trigger language: avoid terms like free, act now, last chance, urgent, limited time, sale, discount, offer, exclusive deal, guaranteed, risk-free, click here, open now, congratulations, winner, verify your account.
* No deceptive prefixes or reply bait: do not use Re:, Fwd:/FW:, or "Regarding."
* No excessive punctuation or symbols: no exclamation marks; no multiple punctuation (??, !!, ?!); no emojis, hashtags, or ASCII art; no ellipses at start/end.
* Neutral, factual tone: no hype, no all caps, no over-promising, no calls to action that sound promotional.
* Character hygiene: standard punctuation; avoid unusual Unicode symbols; no leading/trailing spaces; no double spaces.
* Currency & numbers: prefer spelling out large amounts ("billion," "million") and keep numerals factual (no % off claims). If mentioning money, avoid currency symbols unless essential to the story.
* No dates, IDs, or tracking language: do not include specific dates, edition numbers, UTM-style strings, or "view in browser/unsubscribe" phrasing in copy.
* Company/product names only: reference real entities and features; avoid generic "newsletter," "issue," or "digest" phrasing.
* Self-audit before finalizing: if any line violates the above, rewrite it while preserving the editorial angle.

EMAIL SUBJECT LINE — FINALIZED WITH TITLE CASE
Write 1 subject line using the Top Story Hook strategy. The line must follow these rules:

STYLE & STRUCTURE RULES
✅ Use Title Case: Capitalize the first letter of every major word; lowercase short connector words (like "and," "or," "to," "with," "in") unless they start the line
❌ Do not use colons, semi-colons, dashes, or prefixes (e.g., avoid "Breaking", "Today's Top Story", etc.)
❌ Do not include newsletter cliches like "AI Roundup", "Top Headlines", "AI Summary", "This Week in AI", etc.
❌ Do not include dates, edition numbers, or episode references

✅ Do not exceed 90 characters
✅ The subject line must be a clean, standalone sentence — no list formatting, no quotation marks
✅ No emojis, no exclamation marks, no deceptive reply/forward prefixes, no hype words (per guardrails)
✅ Keep stakes and outcomes clear and business-relevant; maintain a neutral, authoritative tone

TOP STORY HOOK STRATEGY
→ Focus on the lead story (Slot 1). Make it bold, crisp, and attention-grabbing without hype.

Examples:
Netflix Turns Browsing Into a Chatbot
OpenAI Expands Its Reach Into Enterprise Software
Perplexity Replaces Google on Samsung Phones

✅ Use active language and clear stakes
✅ The line must reference at least one real company, product, or named feature/tool
✅ No abstraction — this is editorial copy, not clickbait
✅ Deliverability check: no spam-trigger terms, no promotional tone, no excessive punctuation

---

OUTPUT FORMAT

Return ONLY the subject line as plain text. No JSON, no quotes, no explanation, no markdown.

Example output:
Netflix Turns Browsing Into a Chatbot
