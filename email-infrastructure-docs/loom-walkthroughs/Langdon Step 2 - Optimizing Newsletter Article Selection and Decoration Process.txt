1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:02,207
Okay,

2
00:00:02,515 --> 00:00:04,861
so we now have the articles.

3
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:08,293
They exist in Airtable. We know that they're not duplicated.

4
00:00:08,294 --> 00:00:12,989
We know that they're also fresh. We understand that we now

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,005
need to figure out the topic that they're on.

6
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:18,297
We newsletter in,

7
00:00:18,298 --> 00:00:22,330
which will be used, uh, for segmentation later on in the newsletter.

8
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,208
So that's like what this is. This is the topic.

9
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:28,376
This is also the topic, uhm.

10
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:31,931
So that has to do with topic. We changed the way that we changed

11
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:35,626
the characteristic of topic, so now it's just one word.

12
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:39,728
So we need to figure out the topic. We need to figure out what

13
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:41,766
newsletter it belongs in.

14
00:00:41,837 --> 00:00:45,090
We need to understand how well it fits to that newsletter.

15
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:47,947
Uhm, fitscore is,

16
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:52,807
uhm, is not being used right now. My ambition was to use fitscore

17
00:00:52,808 --> 00:00:58,206
to have a lot of these articles fit into multiple

18
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:01,180
newsletters. They don't just fit into one.

19
00:01:01,373 --> 00:01:06,452
And the benefit of having multiple newsletters and multiple stories per newsletter,

20
00:01:06,453 --> 00:01:08,546
uhm, sorry,

21
00:01:08,547 --> 00:01:10,901
multiple stories per article is,

22
00:01:11,298 --> 00:01:13,732
I think the quality of news will improve.

23
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:18,192
Uhm, my perception is that,

24
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:22,910
yeah. Just, these articles are,

25
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:24,924
uhm, you know, like,

26
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:28,219
Gemini Live, now live on Vertex AI,

27
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,179
this could be an interesting, depending on how it was written in our blog,

28
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,977
this could be an interesting post for Pivot AI,

29
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:37,855
uhm, it's also probably native,

30
00:01:37,856 --> 00:01:41,948
it natively belongs, the fit score is probably highest for Pivot Build,

31
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:45,237
uhm, actually put this into Pivot AI,

32
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,310
which is really interesting, and I think, uhm,

33
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:49,405
eh,

34
00:01:49,406 --> 00:01:51,925
I think that wrestling with how to improve,

35
00:01:51,926 --> 00:01:55,545
uhm, improve the fidelity of the newsletter selection process,

36
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:59,099
I think one of the first things to do is to make it such

37
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,937
that there are mul- multiple stories can be created from a single article,

38
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:05,031
uhm, as opposed to asking it,

39
00:02:05,032 --> 00:02:07,356
asking AI to, you know,

40
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:11,869
divine, you know, divine exactly what newsletters should belong in and expect that it's

41
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,294
going to get it right 100% of the time.

42
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,348
Because it is a, it's a subjective,

43
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,427
like, even two humans, you know,

44
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:24,330
will determine, will have different, uhm, uh, will have draw

45
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:28,871
the line between PivotBuild and PivotAI and PivotInvest will draw the

46
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:31,933
line differently. Uh, and I think that,

47
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,133
I think that, yeah, so I think that that will help basically,

48
00:02:37,134 --> 00:02:40,016
uhm, so that multi-, it's not being forced.

49
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:42,226
It's not a binary thing.

50
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:44,605
I think that's one of the issues with the current flow, is that it's

51
00:02:44,606 --> 00:02:46,758
very binary. It has to pick only one.

52
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:51,342
Uhm, it is worth noting that the flow actually does not just pick

53
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:54,836
only one currently, but only one gets uploaded to Airtable.

54
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:57,437
So, there is an a way to, if you,

55
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:00,802
it doesn't scale, but if you added another column for,

56
00:03:00,803 --> 00:03:03,153
you know, newsletter underscore two, or like, second,

57
00:03:03,154 --> 00:03:05,871
or newsletter underscore three, even, uhm,

58
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:08,312
it would, it would, we have,

59
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,179
the data does exist in the decoration flow to produce,

60
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,175
uhm, Thank you. It already chooses multiple newsletters based on fit score.

61
00:03:15,424 --> 00:03:19,787
It just only uploads the newsletter with the highest fit score into Airtable,

62
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:24,280
and then it gets segmented from there. So we have to fill out these

63
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:26,620
fields, uh, as well as tags.

64
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:31,674
Okay. Uh, that is done by decoration status.

65
00:03:32,107 --> 00:03:35,909
There are three types of decoration status that are being used.

66
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,031
Um, error is not really used.

67
00:03:38,032 --> 00:03:40,067
Um, it could be, but it isn't.

68
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:42,177
Uh, there's pending,

69
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:45,233
which means that decorate, like decoration status. has not happened yet.

70
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,864
There's completed, which is pretty self-explanatory.

71
00:03:47,865 --> 00:03:52,364
And there's skipped low score. So let's go into the decoration flow.

72
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,191
So the decoration flow looks like this.

73
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,016
There are sticky notes to describe what that is.

74
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:04,589
The purpose of the flow is the decoration flow contains multiple

75
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,114
flows. Uh, this is the image flow here creates and uploads the image.

76
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,576
Uh, this is the headline flow.

77
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:13,792
So this creates headlines, bullets, and image prompts.

78
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,810
This one is the, uh, broad,

79
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:20,243
like, scoring and categorization engine. And this is what we'll focus on for the

80
00:04:20,244 --> 00:04:22,556
moment. And then this is fill,

81
00:04:22,557 --> 00:04:25,423
you know, the field that, you know, will not decorate essentially.

82
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:28,642
So this runs every hour, uh,

83
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:32,016
oh, every 20 minutes actually. It's like I changed that.

84
00:04:32,017 --> 00:04:36,691
So this runs every 20 minutes,

85
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:39,813
as it were, basically what it does is in Airtable,

86
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:42,350
there's a filter field that pulls by,

87
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:53,794
uh, needs AI. Yeah.

88
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,048
So we actually do use the needs AI field.

89
00:04:56,049 --> 00:04:58,899
I thought we used decoration status, but apparently not.

90
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:01,287
There is no news here that currently needs AI.

91
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:04,011
It's, oh, there is at the top. So pulls by needs.

92
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,580
And if it's lie or if it,

93
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:10,417
you know, if we've already completed decoration and done scoring and everything that that

94
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:12,760
is automatically checked and that happens at the end here,

95
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:18,529
pull by needs AI. So these are new articles that do need artificial intelligence,

96
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,033
like needs scoring, uh, it creates a prerecord,

97
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,559
and this is just a way to, uhm, it's just a way to preserve

98
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,802
the air table record, basically, for what goes through here,

99
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:32,557
it's used a little bit later. This slice is no longer,

100
00:05:32,558 --> 00:05:34,561
uh, no longer needed, uhm,

101
00:05:34,572 --> 00:05:37,823
it was just used for QA purposes. To reduce the amount of content going

102
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:42,449
through here, this is the anthropic prompt that we use

103
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,206
to determine, you know, your job is for each article,

104
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,186
decide which newsletter the article best belongs in,

105
00:05:49,187 --> 00:05:52,011
this is probably the most important step, uhm,

106
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:54,020
generate the topic, a bunch of tags,

107
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,946
identify the, you know, the core URL, again,

108
00:05:56,947 --> 00:06:00,325
this is no longer super necessary because we link out to our own blog

109
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,196
now, and then determine the sentiment of the news,

110
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:05,755
positive or negative, you know, based on,

111
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,644
there's a scale, positive or negative, and then determine how interesting it is,

112
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:13,383
uh, the interest score, and this, this one is very important,

113
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:15,753
uhm, and then return a JSON object.

114
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,340
So, right now, there are three prompts, right?

115
00:06:18,341 --> 00:06:21,010
You must choose from only three of these newsletters. I'll let you go through

116
00:06:21,011 --> 00:06:23,044
this, but that is,

117
00:06:23,112 --> 00:06:25,706
that's essentially what we are asking, uh,

118
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:30,044
asking this to do. Once it has that,

119
00:06:30,045 --> 00:06:33,966
the response is normalized, the best fit is picked,

120
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:38,135
so this is the step where we strip out the fit score,

121
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:41,077
uh, we basically just keep the bet,

122
00:06:41,078 --> 00:06:43,507
the highest fit score per article,

123
00:06:43,508 --> 00:06:46,511
uhm, per newsletter. So we drop the other recommendations.

124
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:49,869
So if the AI believe Anthropic comes out and says that,

125
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:52,674
you know, this article could fit into two newsletters,

126
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:55,412
and, you know, the fit score for Pivot AI is,

127
00:06:55,597 --> 00:06:58,990
for Pivot Fit is, Pivot 5 is, is 18 and Pivot Build,

128
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:02,993
the fit score is 12. It will drop Pivot Build and only recommend Pivot

129
00:07:02,994 --> 00:07:05,540
AI, uhm,

130
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:10,337
AKA Pivot 5. And then that goes into Airtable and it gets mapped,

131
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:12,890
uh, in the, uh, these fields.

132
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,235
The reason for the fit score, the tags, the sentiment,

133
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:17,607
all that gets filled out.

134
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,276
Some articles, uh,

135
00:07:22,286 --> 00:07:24,818
yeah. And then we mark AI steps as done so that it doesn't do

136
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,643
it again. And that's, that's pretty much it for this flow,

137
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:29,929
this Rosebud. Pretty simple. This flow,

138
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,003
uh, checks for, will not decorate,

139
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:34,486
will not decorate. Basically, I think it's what?

140
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,554
15. Yeah. Interest scores.

141
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:40,260
If an interest score is determined to be below 15,

142
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:43,819
then we won't decorate it. This is out of 25.

143
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,140
So. The fit score and the interest score are out of 25.

144
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,797
Um, so if the interest score is too low,

145
00:07:51,798 --> 00:07:54,370
then we won't end up putting it into a newsletter anyway,

146
00:07:54,534 --> 00:07:56,738
so we're not going to decorate it, uh,

147
00:07:56,749 --> 00:08:00,016
and we will not end up passing it on to newsletter stories.

148
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:03,624
Everything that has a fit score or a,

149
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:08,450
uh, an interest score of above 15 does get passed on to newsletter stories.

150
00:08:09,383 --> 00:08:13,186
So that's what this pool is. These are articles that have a,

151
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:17,706
uh, interest score above 15. So that integer to whatever you wanted,

152
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:20,030
uhm, yeah.

153
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,483
And then, so, WillNotDecorate,

154
00:08:23,484 --> 00:08:25,956
it's like we're only looking for interest score above 15,

155
00:08:25,957 --> 00:08:28,898
uh, and it does not have an interest score,

156
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:32,203
uhm, or sorry, it does have an interest score that is either below either

157
00:08:32,204 --> 00:08:34,404
blank or pending. AKA,

158
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:38,598
it does not have an interest score that is already complete because if the,

159
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,482
uhm, sorry, the decoration status.

160
00:08:42,014 --> 00:08:45,761
So, if the score is under 15,

161
00:08:45,762 --> 00:08:48,704
uh, or it's, you know, coming through as,

162
00:08:48,705 --> 00:08:51,177
uhm,

163
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:55,845
it's really annoying because this and designates

164
00:08:55,846 --> 00:08:58,445
that it has to be both of these things.

165
00:08:58,693 --> 00:09:00,728
So, uhm,

166
00:09:00,738 --> 00:09:05,295
this filter is just designed to, uh, make sure that we haven't already complete,

167
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:07,699
like, we're not going to change a completed,

168
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,057
uh, decoration status to skipped low score ever.

169
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:15,054
It's kind of a double, it's just to make extra sure that we aren't

170
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,646
excluding articles that should go into newsletter stories into,

171
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:22,239
uhm, you know, that we are decorating them and we're not decorating anything else.

172
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,255
So we're not going back and like modifying any of these fields.

173
00:09:25,256 --> 00:09:28,826
Um, yeah. So that's what skipped low score is.

174
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:33,554
Basically it just recognizes that we're not going to decorate articles with a

175
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,738
interest score under 15. And again, you can change it to whatever you wanted.

176
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,594
So that is, and that's,

177
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:45,274
that's basically it for this air table table.

178
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:47,757
This, uh,

179
00:09:47,768 --> 00:09:52,021
this particular, the articles space there after this,

180
00:09:52,022 --> 00:09:55,294
um, articles is not being used. The main purpose is just to pull in

181
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,516
news, score it, determine where it fits,

182
00:09:57,517 --> 00:10:00,666
and then push it into newsletter stories if it's above a certain,

183
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,025
uhm, above a certain threshold.

184
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,021
The pushing into, uh, newsletter stories happens in a different flow.

185
00:10:08,022 --> 00:10:11,729
Uhm, this has been only going on for 10 minutes.

186
00:10:12,489 --> 00:10:15,823
I can just jump into that flow now.

187
00:10:16,177 --> 00:10:18,873
It's the flow right above it. Create headlines,

188
00:10:18,874 --> 00:10:22,625
bullets, and image prompts. So these are stories that could conceivably go into the

189
00:10:22,626 --> 00:10:27,113
newsletter. They have a newsletter story. We've determined that they are,

190
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:30,875
and that's what newsletter stories is, so this is the pool of potential stories

191
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:35,033
that are deemed by Anthropic to have fairly good,

192
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:39,845
uhm, relevance for a specific newsletter and are interesting enough

193
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:42,708
to go into a newsletter. So we want to decorate these,

194
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,973
uhm, we want to add bullets,

195
00:10:44,974 --> 00:10:47,696
we want to create a headline, uhm,

196
00:10:47,707 --> 00:10:52,477
you know, all of that, right? So what we do is pull

197
00:10:52,478 --> 00:10:55,180
by, oh, cool.

198
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:58,494
Any other questions? We pull by interest score,

199
00:10:58,495 --> 00:11:02,481
uh, so this interest score is,

200
00:11:02,482 --> 00:11:07,043
so we're basically just pulling equal to or over 15 and

201
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:10,310
it, uh, needs to be, uhm,

202
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:13,271
uh, isn't pending or blank.

203
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:16,628
So as long as the decoration status is complete,

204
00:11:17,114 --> 00:11:19,995
the initial decoration status, uhm,

205
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:22,899
so as long as this is complete, it means that we actually do in

206
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,925
fact have all of these fields.

207
00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:27,483
We have an interest score and all of that. Again, it's kind of a,

208
00:11:27,484 --> 00:11:31,107
just an extra, uh, extra step because if we're only pulling articles that have

209
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:34,774
an interest score equal to 15 and it's already been computed,

210
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:37,892
that means that the decoration step has already happened.

211
00:11:37,893 --> 00:11:41,623
Uhm, but it's just another way to make sure that we're only getting articles

212
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:44,011
that have data attached so that we don't have blank air tables.

213
00:11:44,012 --> 00:11:46,449
fields, uhm, once we get into newsletter stories.

214
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,222
So we pull by, pull by that from articles,

215
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:53,844
then, uh, build user content.

216
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:58,881
This is a JS node that builds the payload for,

217
00:11:58,882 --> 00:12:01,147
uhm, Anthropic.

218
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:03,358
So this is,

219
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:08,161
uh, marked it, this ends up creating like a markdown format prompt

220
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,559
specifically for Anthropic. So I'll execute this just so you can see what

221
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,011
it builds.

222
00:12:16,012 --> 00:12:21,095
Not that,

223
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:21,801
this.

224
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:28,280
So what it ends up building is user content.

225
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,412
It's a, it's a markdown. Uh,

226
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:34,334
so it's a markdown format. It uses far less credits for,

227
00:12:34,335 --> 00:12:37,452
uhm, it uses less credits than if we were to just have,

228
00:12:37,453 --> 00:12:42,063
like, a completely, if we were to put all of that information into the,

229
00:12:42,064 --> 00:12:45,139
uh, content creator, like the, the Anthropic node.

230
00:12:45,617 --> 00:12:48,011
It also allows us to be agnostic for the nodes.

231
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:54,573
So if the, How

232
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:59,454
do I explain

233
00:12:59,455 --> 00:12:59,694
this?

234
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:07,115
There are, depending on the newsletter,

235
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:10,710
so there are three newsletters that we're building user content for here.

236
00:13:10,711 --> 00:13:13,361
So this, I wanted this step to be agnostic.

237
00:13:13,837 --> 00:13:15,856
You would have, if you added new newsletters,

238
00:13:15,947 --> 00:13:17,953
you would have to add new,

239
00:13:17,954 --> 00:13:20,869
uh, sort of descriptions of the way that you,

240
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,539
like the style, a style guide, right? Like who the audience is,

241
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,743
what the focus is, and what the tone looks like.

242
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:31,299
There are global rules, but there's also rules for each individual newsletter,

243
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,301
right? Mostly to describe the,

244
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:36,011
the audience. Uhm,

245
00:13:36,012 --> 00:13:40,530
so that's important, and that's a big reason that we're

246
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:45,487
also using this system to feed the prompt into Anthropic.

247
00:13:45,488 --> 00:13:47,675
So we pass through this, like, broad,

248
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:52,011
sort of, uhm, description of what each newsletter Later.

249
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:56,461
Uh, what they're looking for, and then we also pass through the newsletter per

250
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:58,907
article. So this one, for example,

251
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:01,519
uhm, where is the newsletter?

252
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,519
Oh,

253
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:12,501
come on.

254
00:14:18,454 --> 00:14:20,514
So the newsletter here is, uh,

255
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:25,205
Pivot AI, aka Pivot 5. We

256
00:14:25,206 --> 00:14:28,647
build user content, and then we pass this whole thing,

257
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,091
pass this whole thing which describes how we want the headlines written,

258
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:34,532
uh, how we, what we want the bullets to look like,

259
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:37,068
you know, the number of sentences, all that sort of stuff,

260
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,616
and then the potential audiences.

261
00:14:39,723 --> 00:14:41,942
So, uh, there's three audiences, PivotInvest,

262
00:14:42,002 --> 00:14:46,803
PivotBuild, PivotAI. We pass all that information through to Anthropic.

263
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:51,898
And then we also give Anthropic the newsletter ID.

264
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:54,766
So, independent of what we've built,

265
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:58,153
so what we build, uh, build goes into here,

266
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:00,701
article markdown start, JSON user content.

267
00:15:00,702 --> 00:15:02,949
Contains the markdown and everything,

268
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:07,342
all the context that Anthropic needs to be able to write the bullets and

269
00:15:07,343 --> 00:15:10,188
headlines and do the bolding, or, it's actually not the bolding,

270
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:13,669
but to write the headlines and bullets. We pass all that through here,

271
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:17,773
and we also pass it the newsletter ID, so that it can select what

272
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:20,720
audience to use. For example,

273
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:25,138
if we pass through Pivot.ai here, it's going to use the pit in user

274
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:28,842
content, there are, there's a description of what the audience is for the Pivot.ai,

275
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:31,486
uhm, and that is the system that we used,

276
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:33,980
so that's how it knows what, uh,

277
00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:37,218
what the, uh, what sort of context we,

278
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,893
sorry, uh, what sort of context to use to write the bullets

279
00:15:43,894 --> 00:15:47,443
and how to write the headline, basically. We also pass through the URL,

280
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:50,001
uh, and we pass through the tags as well.

281
00:15:50,002 --> 00:15:53,087
Uhm, yeah, the tags aren't super useful,

282
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:55,891
but they're, you know, probably useful for social,

283
00:15:55,892 --> 00:15:58,023
actually. So, yeah,

284
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:00,725
you know, please, uh, go create,

285
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:04,568
uh, you know, follow the rules of Build User Content based on what we

286
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:06,732
have written in Build User Content and,

287
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,200
you know, make sure that you're using this particular newsletter,

288
00:16:09,497 --> 00:16:13,314
right? Once we get that, uh,

289
00:16:13,324 --> 00:16:16,011
so that's the content creator, then it goes to bolding.

290
00:16:16,012 --> 00:16:19,859
Uh,

291
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:23,803
bolding is a separate, uh, task, as we figured out with the original Pivot5,

292
00:16:23,804 --> 00:16:28,472
uh, it really is much better if there is a separate anthropic node

293
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:31,750
that, uh, does the bolding as opposed to having it written in Build User

294
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:35,832
content. So the output looks like this.

295
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:39,110
It is just, you know, it's like, we just get everything we need,

296
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:41,668
um, as well as, uh,

297
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,749
yeah. So we, we get everything we need here.

298
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:46,945
Important note, uh,

299
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:49,567
we use news, uh,

300
00:16:49,578 --> 00:16:53,308
we use story, we start using story ID in this flow.

301
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:56,288
So once we hit newsletter stories,

302
00:16:56,289 --> 00:17:00,809
we start using story ID as opposed to the pivot ID,

303
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:04,011
pivot ID is still in here, but pivot ID.

304
00:17:04,012 --> 00:17:07,720
is specific to the article. It's like a record that describes it's a unique

305
00:17:07,721 --> 00:17:12,293
identifier for the article story ID

306
00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:16,296
is, you know, because there could be multiple stories in the future per article,

307
00:17:16,297 --> 00:17:20,011
we created story ID to be able to track all of that.

308
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:22,286
Uhm, so if there, you know,

309
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:26,502
there could be multiple story IDs per pivot ID in the future,

310
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,549
not currently, but in the future.

311
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:33,719
Uhm, I can't remember where story ID

312
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,011
is actually.

313
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:47,022
Calculated. I think it might actually be calculated in this, in this build user

314
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:49,787
ID. Yeah,

315
00:17:49,788 --> 00:17:52,016
I don't think we have,

316
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:54,548
Dory ID.

317
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:56,927
It would make sense that it's calculated here.

318
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,740
So I think it's actually calculated somewhere in build user content.

319
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:10,068
Yeah,

320
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:15,472
build story ID, uhm,

321
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:16,354
fallback

322
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:25,993
to record ID. Yeah, so the reason,

323
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:29,095
so the story ID is the same, and this is a little bit confusing,

324
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:34,121
uh, I'll admit, but the story ID is the same as the record ID

325
00:18:34,122 --> 00:18:37,015
in newsletter stories. Uhm,

326
00:18:37,026 --> 00:18:39,134
I would actually, I think one way to,

327
00:18:39,544 --> 00:18:43,901
it's not necessarily the That's not necessarily a problem, they're not inextricably tied together,

328
00:18:43,902 --> 00:18:48,208
it's just that, uh, it is literally compiled in this flow,

329
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:50,405
and we just made it the same as the record ID,

330
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:53,063
I think that could get confusing in the future,

331
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:55,931
if you wanted to, you could come up with a new formula to calculate

332
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:59,383
it to calculate story ID so that it just, it wasn't a record ID,

333
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,825
you could also just, you know,

334
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:06,649
recognize that the record ID is different than the story ID in future flows,

335
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,071
uhm, that, like, the record ID for a story in this,

336
00:19:10,072 --> 00:19:13,119
uh, uhm, in this flow,

337
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,592
the record ID is going to be different than the story ID,

338
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:19,376
uhm, yeah. So it's not necessarily an issue,

339
00:19:19,377 --> 00:19:22,115
but it is a little bit confusing, I'll, I'll grant.

340
00:19:26,945 --> 00:19:28,959
So, we move forward with story, we do the bolding, Blah, blah, blah, blah,

341
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,099
blah. I won't wait for this to complete.

342
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:33,799
We've done the bolding, it produces this, we normalize it,

343
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,640
uhm, we then enrich with AI data.

344
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:39,626
I believe that this is for, yeah,

345
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:43,560
so this is just enriching the existing newsletter story record.

346
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,785
We enrich it with this data.

347
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:49,650
So that's where these columns come from. So we update Airtable,

348
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:54,052
uhm, we mark that the AI has been done.

349
00:19:54,053 --> 00:19:56,227
Uh, so we just want,

350
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,737
you know, AI processed, AI is complete,

351
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:01,390
and then we write the date, that it was processed at,

352
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:04,568
and then, uh, decorations data,

353
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:06,795
yeah. So this is then back on the article table,

354
00:20:06,796 --> 00:20:11,821
decoration status is complete. So that is what this is

355
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:14,108
here. Decoration status is complete.

356
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:18,062
So we've finished, uh, with, uh, with that decoration step,

357
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,514
basically. So we know, you know, when we go through articles,

358
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:24,330
we know that certain articles are going to be in newsletter stories,

359
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:26,899
certain, you know, some are not going to be, and this is the field

360
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,515
that we use to determine that. Yeah.

361
00:20:31,516 --> 00:20:35,027
So that is, that's this step. Uhm,

362
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,758
Kriha, yeah, I don't think there's anything else about this step that is,

363
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:41,775
uhm,

364
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:46,141
that is unique. Again, if you wanted to add new newsletters,

365
00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:48,870
you would need to update this node.

366
00:20:48,995 --> 00:20:51,603
This node describes the, what the audience is.

367
00:20:51,604 --> 00:20:54,321
Uhm,

368
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:56,428
so if you added new newsletters, you'd need to update.

369
00:20:56,649 --> 00:20:59,315
You'd need to add an audience. This is where you would add an audience

370
00:20:59,316 --> 00:21:01,996
profile, right? Like what exactly the site,

371
00:21:01,997 --> 00:21:04,048
you know, what, outside of all the global rules, you know,

372
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:06,079
rules, like what is the audience for this new newsletter.

373
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,083
Uhm, yeah.

374
00:21:10,256 --> 00:21:13,567
I think that is it. We also have loop over items for this because

375
00:21:13,568 --> 00:21:16,504
we don't want to hammer, we don't want to hit Anthropic's rate limits.

376
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:24,835
Just trying to make sure that there's nothing in this flow that

377
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:28,192
is convoluted and needs explanation.

378
00:21:34,683 --> 00:21:37,948
Yeah. Yeah. So that is it. It, AI deck is not really used.

379
00:21:38,124 --> 00:21:40,285
It's kind of like a short summary. Um,

380
00:21:40,296 --> 00:21:42,566
I don't use it for anything right now. Um,

381
00:21:42,577 --> 00:21:45,441
it's by story. So it's, it can't be used for like,

382
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,634
it can't be news not used on like the newsletter issue level,

383
00:21:49,635 --> 00:21:52,016
uh, later. So I just don't really.

384
00:21:52,017 --> 00:21:54,540
I don't really do anything with this. I, there is,

385
00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:56,941
there are summaries that are created with, you know,

386
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:59,051
news that's been selected for a specific newsletter,

387
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:01,849
but that happens a little bit later and we actually don't have that in

388
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:08,995
the current version of the newsletter anyway. So

389
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:11,571
that's it for this stage of the decoration flow.

390
00:22:11,572 --> 00:22:14,893
Um, we will now move on to,

391
00:22:15,497 --> 00:22:19,171
we'll move on to images, the rest of these fields,

392
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,580
basically. Yeah.

393
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:24,011
Everything past, you know, selected for publication.

394
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:26,537
The date that it was published, image URL,

395
00:22:26,538 --> 00:22:28,604
all that is created in a later flow.

396
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:30,907
The purpose of the flow that I just showed you,

397
00:22:30,908 --> 00:22:34,462
uh, this flow is just to create the bullets, headlines in the building for

398
00:22:34,463 --> 00:22:38,721
eligible stories, uh, and also to populate the newsletter stories,

399
00:22:38,722 --> 00:22:40,949
uh, table. That is what this does.

400
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,583
Uh, this populates the newsletter stories table from the articles table.

401
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:46,823
Um, that's, that's how that happens.

402
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:50,541
So, I'll end this one here and then move on to,

403
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:52,129
uh, the next flow.
