Pat Simmons
How's it going?

Langdon Miller
Going well Yeah, moving along. Are you on the West Coast?

Pat Simmons
Yeah, yeah, I'm back in Moran right now. Yeah. Incredible. It's so nice. The weather. I bet the weather's nice. It's actually really shitty right now, believe it or not. I the sun just came out a second ago, but it's been like uh it's been it looks like it's gonna be foggy like overcasts all week.

Speaker 3
Rare Where Nar where exactly are you?

Pat Simmons
Nevada.

Langdon Miller
Interesting. Yeah, I don't know Nevada weather actually.

Pat Simmons
Yeah, it's a lot it's a little hotter than than like yeah than like uh Moran like northern Marin. or Southern Marin.

Speaker 3
They're like microclimates. There really are microclimates. Like Simson Beach is totally different than just Ten minutes up the way.

Pat Simmons
A hundred percent. Yeah. Just ten minutes over the coal. Yeah, it could be like a ten degree difference because you get all the all the fog from San Francisco like in Southern Marin. So it would yeah, it can be a ten, ten degree, fifteen degree difference between Quartermate era and Nevado.

Langdon Miller
A hundred percent. Uh and then yeah, like if you're in the

Speaker 3
Like the like Tam Valley is oftentimes cloudy, but then if you like Mill Valley isn't because it's you know 200 feet higher. So it's like above the log.

Pat Simmons
Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah, that's that's why we love it. Just got all that all that uh makes for just like great everything, nature and everything else

Speaker 3
For sure. Um so I hear you're taking over the Pivot News project.

Pat Simmons
I don't think I have a choice. Yeah. Yeah. Don't think don't think it was uh It was my choice. No. It's yeah. Obviously it makes sense.

Speaker 3
Of course it's your choice. Uh I mean it's it's it's a it's it's a um Are you gonna continue uh just out of curiosity, are you gonna continue working for him like on a contracting basis? Or is he or are you thinking of like a deeper engagement with pivot media like specifically?

Pat Simmons
Uh contracting basis, yeah. Cause I have other clients. I can't I can't give up those relationships. Um so yeah, it's just gonna be a consulting contracting basis. Um yeah, we're gonna continue continue to play it by year and and just kind of see, but Um cool. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so what so you you just you just were tell me, tell me. Give me uh give me all the details. What what's the what's the what's the reason? Um I don't need to share this with him either. Like I'm just uh genuinely curious.

Speaker 3
It just wasn't the right fit. Like the the place I am in my career is like I Kunal wanted me to the the pitch was to take a company from one. You know, Kunal is really good at the zero to one phase of company, zero to a million dollars. And then to take a company from one to ten, he doesn't really like to do. It's not his specialty. That's what I like to do. I like to do that with that's kind of like what being a programmatic director is about. That's like what being a re that's like what owning a So I like that part. I'm it's an operator. I like being an operator. The thing is that pivot media is not at that phase. Like the the work that's happening right now that I'm having to do, like I would not be able to quit my job and work on full time. Like it's too early. And it's just not the right if the timing is off. I have no doubt that Pivot Media is going to be a successful like company. The problem is that the risk is still there. And I can't operate, I can't leave my career um to do that, basically. That's really yep.

Pat Simmons
Totally fair, totally fair. And you're absolutely right. Like it's just not, it's just not at the one stage yet.

Speaker 3
Yeah. Um and yeah, keep that between us. Because like I told Kunal that, but you know, just Absolutely.

Pat Simmons
Yeah, man. No, no, no worries. Like, yeah, I'm uh I I did yeah, I was I was just kind of curious like kind of where your head's at because Yeah, it's the same thing with me and him. I mean it's just it's consult it's consulting, you know, gig here. It's not we're not we're not full-time employees. Um so it is kind of a yeah just a different type of relationship.

Speaker 3
Um it's up to there's an enormous amount of work required to scale the business from this from the current level to the one level. Like to get there requires scaling everything. Like from the email server to the email list to the ad server capability to the like the the em there there's a lot of work there yeah basically and I could do it if I was But it it's just too much like I can't have two jobs at the same time. Exactly. And I I don't want that lifestyle.

Pat Simmons
A hundred percent. Yeah. No, you've been I I can tell you just grinding too. I can't imagine having a full-time job while you're doing all of this. Me neither. Fucking crazy dude. Insane.

Speaker 3
The life of a consultant. I mean you You see you got into the consultant business fairly early in your career, I feel like. Like you split off into consultancy fairly early, it seems like.

Pat Simmons
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I basically after ad agencies I went right into it. Um and yeah, I I prefer it because yeah, I mean it's it um I mean yeah, you don't it doesn't feel like a full-time job. Like it you can't you can do other things. You can choose the freedom if you want. Like if I wanted to, I could I could too could tell my other clients or even can all say, I need I need to, you know, take some time off, need to take a few weeks, or just, you know, fire fire the clients. Um but yeah it is nice. You do have that flexibility. You do have that flexibility. I mean there are other drawbacks, but um at the le at the very least, yeah, it's uh I can you know, take time off when I need to. But then now that I always have the option to take time off or do whatever, I don't want to ever stop. So that's uh that's that's kinda problem.

Speaker 3
He didn't ask, but like my my dad has been a has been a consultant. He he had a he had a good career in the 80s working in media at like Vanity Fair and Esquire and blah blah blah And then he pivoted to consulting since then. And he's been consulting. He's been like an independent consultant, you know, publishing books and helping with advertising and just all kinds of he's been an 1099 contractor for 30 years. And I was talking to him about this decision, and one of the interesting things is that like there is Yeah, it's a di there there are two different there there are there are pros and cons to both. Part of the cons of consulting is that you always feel like you should be doing more because you're selling your time basically. So it's like you could get ahead by dedicating more of your it's tied to the amount of time you spent. Although you know you can like do weird stuff with hours and stuff, but like broadly it's like you're selling like time. And that he so he's been running for like thirty years. Uh and I don't think he regrets it. You can make a lot of money consulting, to be clear. Like I think I actually prefer to some degree like having the full-time job because if I don't work I get paid the same amount of money. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, that's really enough. Or I, you know, whatever, I still get paid unless I get actually fired, which

Pat Simmons
is always a risk. And then you can go but you can go find another job too. Yeah. It's like yeah, they're there yeah, wa you you know you'll have like a few weeks if you're looking for a job and you'll you'll be able to Find it. So yeah, that's absolutely the it's just yeah, just risk tolerance at the end of the day. But that's sick. He's been doing that for 30 years. That's the problem that I that I run into too. I mean, I do have the entrepreneurial spirit and I do um I do see just the opportunities in AI and I have so many ideas. Um and yeah, part of me is like itching itching for the entrepreneurial side too and just starting like a just a little agent little mini like consulting company where I'm not selling my time but I can hire people to, you know, have them come in like a McKinsey and just have you know, be selling their their time. Totally. Um yeah. Well let me know if you ever need help with any of that. Yeah, dude, I'll I'll for sure hit you up. Yeah, we'll we'll see. I I do love, I mean, what what we're I I just like love the building component too. Like and I do like doing this stuff with Kunal, I'm like, fuck, this is actually really fun and we're doing some pretty crazy shit. Like most of the time I'm solving a very specific problem for a client and it's like frankly just Kind of a boring problem that can be like aug augmented that can be solved relatively easy with AI. So it's like easy and it pays well and it's like but it's so boring it's just like I'm like I like I do kind of like being in the weeds and just building cool shit too

Speaker 3
This is pretty cool shit, I have to say. That was one of my hesitancies about like leaving the opportunity was it it it really is pretty it really is pretty cool shit. Um

Pat Simmons
Yeah, and you you can always I mean i yeah I mean it sounds like you guys like are ending it am amicably too so you can always go back because you're right like and I think Kunal would definitely recognize that. Like w as you're saying it, like it's just not at the one the one stage yet. And and when it does get there, then that's when, yeah, that's when you can come in and like really turn it into an operational machine.

Speaker 3
Yeah, he knows that.

Pat Simmons
Um and I have a feeling I'll be working with him again. Yeah.

Speaker 4
I don't know likely.

Pat Simmons
And yeah, I mean dude, yeah, just having a full-time job. It's like Jesus Christ, having two of these. How long have you been working? Were you uh did you start like when I started or earlier? With canal? Yeah.

Langdon Miller
I met Kunal at a conference in Portugal like a month and a half ago and I started working on November 10th.

Pat Simmons
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. So we started working at like the exact same time. Yeah. Yeah. So you just I can grind it. Oh also, dude, yeah, okay, yeah, I've been going to transition. I've been going through your this is crazy. I I have no idea, dude. This is like this is some fucking like absolute Like Rain Man shit.

Speaker 3
No, it's not. It looks more complicated than it is.

Pat Simmons
No, I'm not. No, no, no. I'm com- I'm That's a compliment. I I'm not all I know I'm at it, but yeah, it's like the way you've the way you've configured it. I'm like That Uh yeah, I'm impressed. It's uh it's really really uh thorough and um yeah, just a lot of breadth to it. And yeah, I think y you're right. It like seems more more complicated than this, but there's still all these like edge cases and stuff that Uh it seems like you've yeah you've like solved and have the the plumbing in place for all of this.

Langdon Miller
Honestly, I think the uh the the

Speaker 3
The um the flow here is fairly like hardened the the way that it currently exists. Like to produce these three newsletters The flow is fairly hard. I think where you're gonna run into if he I don't know what the scope of your work is like what exactly he's asking you to do, but if you modify this flow such that you support more newsletters I tried to be um I tried to be descriptive in pointing out where what you're gonna need to change if you do that. There's like places you're gonna need to change and they're in those looms I I point out in those flows. Yep. Um I also think that When you add if you decide to, you know, if he wants like a real estate newsletter or something and you like start compiling stories for that and you add these courses Those sources are going to there are sometimes there's sometimes issues with adding sources with like shit getting dropped basically like You know, every single one of these pages describes like what the date published is defined differently. So when he comes out of Fire Crawl That's like one edge case that I've solved for all the sources that are in there. Um so like in the near term it won't be a problem. Uh but sometimes adding sources can cause issues. Cells are gonna be blank in air table, basically. I have to go back and like what source is causing this blank, like why is ISO date not coming through as ISO date, coming through as date underscore published or date slash published or date dash published, you know whatever. Yeah, but uh yeah no I I I would say that this the current flow is fairly is like fairly is fairly robust. It's been tested over a period of this has been running for probably two weeks, and I've solved as many bugs as I could in that time period.

Pat Simmons
Nice, nice. Yeah, so so Kunal really just needs me to well first thing I wanted to talk to you today, to use this time today, because yeah, I'm pretty much up to speed. I didn't actually finish the I'm still uh midway through the image flow, but I think I just generally uh understand the the flow as a whole. So what Kunal wants wants me to just immediately do is just get this uh sending over to Mautic, just integrated with the Mautic A API. Um yeah, it is. It it is, okay. Uh Okay, tight. Um so it's it's yeah, because I didn't watch the uh the with the HTML um the last video.

Speaker 3
But um do you know what list he wants you to use? Have you been into Montic?

Pat Simmons
Yeah yeah I saw the the warmup list. I think it's uh Pierre sent an email it's something warm-up uh let's Let's see, was it segments?

Langdon Miller
Uh, warm up warming tab, imagine it is One of the probably warm up all emails. I think that's it.

Pat Simmons
Yeah, let me just confirm because Pierre has a he says please use let's see what does he say warm up

Langdon Miller
And the warm-up process for these emails is very interesting.

Pat Simmons
Yeah

Langdon Miller
Yeah, it's uh Yeah, it's really all it like all you have to do with these, and I explained this in that HTML thing, but Like this is ID9. That's that is the name of this segment. All you have to do is in the compile flow in create email. In the body of the JSON request, list is nine.

Speaker 3
Right now the list is three. Oh. It references a segment. The segment is like the E is like the list. It's like the

Pat Simmons
It's the it's the sec it's literally just the segment. So so three is just another one is another one. So we just need to change it to nine.

Speaker 3
Three is this one.

Speaker 4
Oh it's internal.

Speaker 3
So it's to Kunal, Pierre, and myself.

Pat Simmons
Sick. Okay cool. So yeah, he um I just looked at Pierre's email. It says yeah, warm-up hyphen all emails. So I think it's nine that you were just looking at. So you've just uh let's see one poly emails. Yeah, nine. Okay, cool. Do you want to just change that uh in the JSON right now? Alright, sec. Boom. And then just execute that node. The 830.

Langdon Miller
Uh 830 a. m. if you want it to run at 8. Now it runs at 8. I think I did that correctly. Yeah, I don't know. I think he wants this to go out at eight actually he wants it to go out at at five, if I'm not mistaken. And AM. Yeah, pivot five should go out at five AM. Okay. So Eastern? East uh yeah, Eastern.

Pat Simmons
Okay, okay, cool. Yeah. Alright, sick. So I wonder, can you just execute that nap the the node you're in now? Because it uh if you just execute it manually, it'll just it'll just go through. Um it'll send. Yeah. Like if I executed this, it would send to them. Can you can you execute it? It's they're all fake emails for the warm-up. So Canal wanted me to literally just wanted us to just literally hit execute and just send it to Montec. Let me just let me uh

Langdon Miller
So what I would do the first couple times, like I'm just gonna look at this email in Mautic and make sure that it looks Correct. Okay. Okay, cool. Let's pivot five. So now we're pulling from yeah, next ten. So there actually is a newsletter. What am I doing right now? Oh yeah. 140 485 pending. You can go in here and preview it.

Pat Simmons
Oh sick. Okay.

Langdon Miller
Preview. Looks good to me. We will send. Nice. You just that's what you just executed? Say it again? That's what you just executed? Yeah, it just created this email. Hell yeah. Alright, that's sick. It just created the email and then you hit I mean you this attaches the transport, which is like the to and from and like the custom headers that we have set up to send from the custom domain. And then I mean yeah, I'll just execute it. Okay, sick. And then I say this in the HTML thing, but if I were you, I would like to In here, sent count.

Speaker 3
This is how many you sent. Uh and failed recipients. I would pull this into air table or something because this is like the most valuable data around like was the email like did it actually go anywhere because it even sometimes it'll say success but sent count will be zero and failed recipients will be four eighty five but it'll count it'll run through and check all these boxes and air table like

Langdon Miller
Yep, sent, good to go, but it didn't send. Yeah. So I would rem I would actually remove this. This one is fine. I would remove this shit and change this to something else. This is the air table that just says like um Actually it's both, but whatever.

Speaker 3
The combination of variables like removes from this table, the working table, and adds through the archive table To say sent, complete, done. Now it's an archive. Got it, okay. I'm gonna add an extra step in there that's like only mark as sent if failed recipient is zero. Got it, got it, yeah. Yeah.

Langdon Miller
Uh No, I like go in a Maltech and see that yep 485 sent 120 red. Wow, that was fast. Crazy.

Pat Simmons
These people are just like waiting for these now.

Speaker 3
Super engaged with the content is what they are.

Pat Simmons
They're such a it's crazy that Google hasn't picked up on that spam signal if uh or maybe they have, but like come on.

Speaker 3
I don't know to what degree, but like

Pat Simmons
You know Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's like that's such a blatant go. I don't even think because I actually do a lot of this email stuff and instantly So I do a lot of email campaigns and do a lot of domain configurations and all that kind of stuff and yeah it's like what are we doing? It's like it's so we need to be smarter about this like Just immediately 25% of the recipient and they're not gonna probably not gonna change that. They're not gonna drip that out. It's just gonna be God, come on.

Langdon Miller
Bang, bang, bang. I reload the page.

Pat Simmons
Oh, another another one. Another one. That person was late. What were they doing? Come on.

Langdon Miller
So anyway, this is how that works. Um if you want to send me, if you want to send other newsletters

Speaker 3
I think you can literally if you wanted to be simple, you could just duplicate this.

Langdon Miller
Like I have this flow of duplicated uh this is like the sending component, the actual send part for Gmail. I have so you could literally just duplicate this, but you actually don't I don't think you Um yeah, like what about this? Yeah, just gonna have to duplicate it, I'm afraid, because there's stuff in here like Technically, you probably don't need to.

Speaker 3
Like I think if you change the filter so that it pulled in.

Langdon Miller
Right now it's filtered to pivot AI, but if you filtered this to you know the three newsletters or just took just removed this entire

Speaker 3
I'm trying to say if you pulled all of these in and hooked them up to this Mautic situation, like would it create three emails or would it only create the first email? I'm not there's probably a way to get it to create three emails. Like I'm sure ChatGPT could help you with that. Yeah if it didn't automatically just create three emails.

Langdon Miller
And then the rest of this flo the attached transport thing, this transport is different per newsletter. Got it, got it. That makes sense.

Speaker 3
Yeah, because it's different audience. I might just duplicate this flow for because there's only three newsletters right now. For the time being, I might just duplicate this flow for um

Langdon Miller
Pivot build pivot invest if that's what he wants you to do.

Pat Simmons
Yeah. Uh dumb question, are are we doing uh pivot invest and pivot build too? We're we're we're sending it we're warming up that that segment as well in Martin?

Langdon Miller
I don't think we're warming that up yet, no. But it is being built.

Speaker 3
I mean it it's still going out every day

Pat Simmons
Okay.

Speaker 3
It's going out internally through this Gmail node.

Pat Simmons
It's just Gmail. Okay, yeah, you mentioned that.

Langdon Miller
Yeah.

Pat Simmons
Okay, okay, cool. Cool. So eventually, so that's what you're saying. So eventually I need to just duplicate that or uh and get it configured for for the other um verticals.

Langdon Miller
And I would keep this node right here tells you what transport to use for each uh newsletter. Nice. So like this is Fucking useless. I don't know what we'd use that for. Daily this is pivot five from name pivot five. Yeah And then pivot before and then there's also pivot build. Alright, it's like it's just these IDs. This is the number you want.

Pat Simmons
Alright, cool, cool. Related to that, so the pivot news website, I I know I've asked this like three times now. Are we taking the pivot news pivot Build and pivot invest in in putting that into the pivot news website as well, or is it just pivot five aka pivot AI? I don't know. Okay

Langdon Miller
I think it might just be pivot five. I haven't seen well, let's look.

Pat Simmons
Yeah, it's so what what was happening in pivot new oh I see what you're doing. You're checking the the checking like what went out. Yes

Langdon Miller
And actually it's my own freaking Yeah, it's not we're not using it for pivot build because we're linking out to other Okay. new sources. So we're not doing it for pivot build right now and we're probably not doing it for pivot invest either.

Pat Simmons
Okay Did Canal mention that at all? Does he want to do that or is that just not a I think he probably does want to do that?

Langdon Miller
I think he is what's happening is I think he is like very focused. Yeah, it's not working for Pivot and Best either.

Speaker 3
He's very focused on warming up the email infrastructure because all the ad dollars are tied to pivot five. Got it, got it. So that's the priority. Yeah. That's the priority. But I mean we already built these freaking like I'd be shocked if His newsletters are like Pivot Build and Pivot Invest are like ninety-five percent done. Like they're already being automatic like automatically compiled. It's like free advertising inventory at this point. Like he's already paid me to make them. He should use them and sell to like Fisher Investments and whoever. Like this is a valuable segment. That's why we built it. 100%. So Because my point is like, yeah, totally should be also doing pivot build and pivot invest, but I don't think it's his priority right now.

Pat Simmons
Okay. Okay, cool. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's that's good to know. So the The because I noticed on the website, the Pivot News website, I wonder if I can just filter that out and just have Pivot 5 uh showing up. Um because what was happening is the And when you show me those, those images were being generated, but in the actual air table, it's just showing like JSON image URL for some reason. Uh-huh. I also saw that. Yeah, so it's just like breaking like some of it's showing up, but um but yeah, it's just breaking the image and then in the front end in the pivot news site, yeah, it just has that.

Langdon Miller
Yeah, it's You know, I actually don't know why this is happening. JSON image URL. So it's coming from here. It's not coming from there. You know what? Although do I have this? No, there's no filter. So these are all the newsletters. Because like look at this story. Like I bet this has an image attached to it. Yeah.

Pat Simmons
There is an image for this story. Oh, so okay, so they're just they're not.

Langdon Miller
Something that's happening specifically with this flow, which means that it's in uh um Oh, is it making it into the newsletter? Yeah, it looks like it's not. Oh, okay. They're not yeah, it's not making it into the newsletter. So something is happening in this in this flow because this is the flow that like pivot build for example. Okay, so that's Pivot Invest. So we have an issue compiled for Pivot Invest. And I wonder. Fucking image URL Oh yeah, look at this.

Pat Simmons
Oh okay, so you just need to this is literally just it's yeah, it's the r it's the the whatever the JSON actually is called. Image UR boom, there you go. Boom. Which it just one of Oh I see. Okay, it was just hard coded. Alright, interesting.

Langdon Miller
Yeah, I don't know how that happened. Yeah. Actually. Image prompt. We don't even use image prompt anymore. Oh really? We do the way that you do it by just like plugging in the uh It should be called a same freaking game, so That's interesting. How that's Huh, so did this one work? Honestly, the image flow is a little bit of a a little bit of a pain in the ass.

Speaker 3
Just because there's a lot of different reasons why Gemini can fail to generate an image.

Pat Simmons
Uh-huh, yeah, I've seen that too. Yeah, I know you mentioned that. Yeah, I need to come up with some sort of like fallback. I don't know what that is.

Langdon Miller
That well that ex that's why so it's pivot invest that is the issue here.

Pat Simmons
Okay. But but now that that worked that that uh brought over the major now

Langdon Miller
Yeah, see build like today's edition of build had all the images, so it's fine. Um and in air table uh um Let's see, pivot, newsletter issue, stories What was the issue that we just compiled? Build 16th in the morning. Yeah. There are all images here. Oh oh nice nice nice. And then but pivot it's pivot invest now that is the problem. Okay. But what you just executed that that didn't work? That was for pivot invest and I need to we need to find uh actually should be this It's because I already executed it and then changed it. So like I'll just do it again. Got it. And it should be called invest Should we call the same thing as should we call that? So now they have pivot invest December 16th, the PM editions, it was compiled after 5 p. m. or before 5 p. m. excuse me, and it does have images. So perfect.

Pat Simmons
Nice. Okay. Yeah. Okay, cool. So that yeah that should um that should fix the on pivot news as well. And then like the the the flow is pretty much running. Like the the the mozic thing that we just executed, that would have run at that would have run at When would that run? It it would have run at 8 a. m. this this morning or tomorrow mor This morning. Okay. Okay, cool. So like tomorrow at 8 a. m. Eastern in theory it should it should just auto-execute as well. It will auto-execute. Yes. Boom. And it'll go to list nine now. Got it, got it. Okay. So did do you did it send today to list three? Is that a good idea? Probably what happened. Okay, cool. So we just uh that's all I need that's all we needed to do. Okay, perfect. Hell yeah Alright. I think that's pretty much pretty much it. Stories. Yeah, that's all that's all I've got. I mean this thing is like already ready to go. It's just I just need to go in and tweak some things as you mentioned.

Speaker 3
Yeah, pretty much like if if you didn't do anything for the rest of the year and it just sent to the same warm-up list and the the there's no There's no like immediate changes that need to be made to the flow to get it to operate properly and send an automatic newsletter every day. Um what Kunal's probably gonna ask you to do is improve the news quality at some point.

Pat Simmons
The editor. He's mentioned that.

Speaker 3
Yeah. So that is that's gonna be your real Take it. Uh that's gonna be the real task because the honestly I think the best thing I there's a bunch of different things you could do in my if if you want to hear that I thought about. Yeah, let's hear it. I've heard I've thought of like allowing only certain sources into certain newsletters. I've thought about um breaking apart the story ID. Basically, anthropic right now.

Langdon Miller
And this is, I think, the most impactful um broad categorization. Yeah, scoring trigger. Oh, come on.

Speaker 3
Can't basically uh this node right here, so and through this is on articles. So it's like we have shitloads of articles, thousands of articles. articles. What is you know compute an interest score, compute uh like score them and then to tell me which newsletter they fit into. That's what this does. It also computes a fit score. The fit score is like how closely, how confident are you that this piece of news fits into this newsletter? Got it. And right now it computes multiple bit scores for a piece of news.

Pat Simmons
So Yeah, and this is the 15 greater than or equal to 15

Speaker 3
Say it again, I'm sorry? Yeah. This this is like it uh um I'll show you.

Langdon Miller
RKAISDSE DONE So it's like you know what piece of news is best I'm just gonna pin this and run away from me uh

Speaker 3
Pivot AI. So in this case it only chose one, but sometimes it chooses uh multiple. Actually, like it's allowed to choose multiple. It can choose multiple newsletters right now. Yeah. And you can the prompt such that it feels comfortable choosing multiple newsletters, even more so than it currently does. This node basically strips the multiple and says what is the fit like what is the primary newsletter that it fits into? Like in other words, what newsletter is the fit score the highest for? And then throw away the rest. It's binary. It's like, and I think that that is a key problem with this flow. Yeah. Actually. Because it's like Pick one like this piece of news, for example, you know, a strategic partnership covering AI power digital transformations across multiple industries with a genetic AI applications. That fits build and pivot AI. Yeah. It there just depends how you write the story. Yeah. Um so I think the fact that we are forcing it to choose one newsletter is like I mean a human wouldn't be able to do that.

Speaker 4
Uh-huh.

Speaker 3
Do you know what I mean? Like Kunal covered because he's been editing this newsletter for months. Uh-huh. But like an eye like would struggle to be able to tell you like what if if something is relevant for It's it's it's just a very fine line. Like it's a very sophisticated intellectual question actually, based exactly who we know to be the audience at pivot five. You know what I mean?

Pat Simmons
Yeah.

Speaker 3
And so I guess what I'm trying to say is that like if you allow the newsletter to pick multiple Um, so that you can populate newsletter stories with multiple stories written on one article, I think you would get a much richer selection when you actually hammer down later in the flow. And ask it to um ask it to uh where is my assemble? When you basically ask it to pick all these positions. Like I want you to pick a big macro story. Like this, look if you read this This could easily fit into Pivot Invest. Easily. This is a big story about a big company making big moves in the market. Right? Like those stories are gonna fit. Those are from Bloomberg, Financial Times, Wall Street Journal. Those pieces also fit into Pivot Invest very easily. But that's what we want as story number one for Pivot Five. Stormway two is like geopolitical. This is gonna come from semaphore. Semaphore or CMBC or the Wall Street Journal, like one of those other sources. But then you get down to like position five and like this is gonna come from the tech verge or you know a tech crunch or the verge or like softer new, probably Google News too, some random news outlet in Google News.

Langdon Miller
Got it.

Speaker 3
So I think if you allowed AI, we'd get a much richer selection in here, because right now it's just picking by interest score and we're overweighting interest score that are more like story number one because the sources are really good, the articles are written really well, uh, and even though they're not like a perfect You understand what I'm saying?

Pat Simmons
Yeah, I get what you're saying. Absolutely. Yeah, so it's um I think we so much. Or multiple articles. Yeah.

Speaker 3
Multiple stories per article. And that wouldn't be much of a tweak. You would just need to figure out how exactly you want to structure it. Like if that means that you put a You know, in articles you put like newsletter one, newsletter two.

Pat Simmons
Okay, cool.

Speaker 3
Yeah. Or you don't do that at all. Um Yeah, you just have to figure out how exactly like structurally you want to do that. Um but the functionality is already there. It just needs to be like put into air cable, basically. Cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. That's pretty much it, dude. Like let me know if you have questions about the um about the flow. Um anything with regards to it. I'm uh working through Friday. So Friday is my last day. Okay, cool. So if you do have questions. Um let me know. But also like if you want to meet uh in person in the city or something like that and get coffee, I'm happy to do that too.

Langdon Miller
Yeah.

Speaker 3
Yeah. Yeah. Or when we get back, like in January, because we're both gone basically through the end of the year.

Pat Simmons
Yeah, let's just let's just catch up as uh as Piers. Uh I w I wanna I won't ask you any uh workful of questions. But I think this is relatively straightforward. I'm assuming uh I uh I'll be able to to figure it out and get it all configured and then yeah, I'll just let I'll ask you any questions up to Friday and then I'll uh I'll run with this and hopefully uh get it over to uh more operationally focused guy. Is that right?

Speaker 3
Uh yeah, I wonder where Kunal's gonna find this person.

Pat Simmons
Yeah, no, I don't know. Kunal hasn't even mentioned that, but I'm just like because I'm gl I'm I'm like Kunal. I'm like a zero to one guy. I'm I'm I'm the the like Just try to get out of the weeds as much as possible.

Speaker 3
I like the operating stuff because it's like Once the business is once the biggest once the business is big enough, like the this is gonna sound sort of like obnoxious, but like it It does become more like it's big it's like less building, more like strategic. Yeah, absolutely. If you grow a business that's worth a million dollars to five million dollars, you can get you know getting paid a million dollars is not unreasonable. Absolutely. You know, growing business from zero to one, it's like the risk is just like high. Like the chance of getting to one is like low, you know, statistically. Absolutely. So it's like and then it's like how much time can I dedicate? And like blah blah blah. And I didn't really know this about myself until the Pivot 5 um until the Pivot Media experiment, but I I'm I I like my cozy operator ecosystem.

Pat Simmons
Yeah, no, it makes sense. You're you're absolutely right. The ROI is like just just so much higher. And it when you're at that level, you're yeah, you're it's exactly what you're saying. You're taking on more of a managerial role. You're you're you're You're operating the operators. Like you're getting the the you're not really in the weeds. Those people like below you are in the weeds and you have like you're thinking more like, yeah, big strategic vision on how to like architect your uh workforce and uh yeah make people like as efficient as possible. Yeah. Yeah. So hell yeah dude. So you're gonna keep you what's that? No, go ahead. You're gonna keep you're s you're gonna stay at uh what's the company called? Uh Smart. Brainley, but probably not.

Speaker 3
I'm probably gonna do something else or something like Dude, I'm bored out of my fucking skull at Brainley. Like I just got promoted too, and like dude, I just don't care. It's kind of a good problem to have.

Pat Simmons
Huh? It's kind of a good problem to have if you're just like It's a good problem to have. That means you know the business.

Speaker 3
Dude, I'm so bored. Like, I mean that's part of the reason I was so excited for all of this is like I was like actually learning something new. Like I haven't learned something new in years. Yeah, interesting.

Pat Simmons
I haven't needed to. Um buttons next year when I'm uh trying to build out uh uh uh an agency. Please do.

Speaker 3
I'll keep you entertained.

Langdon Miller
Truly, especially if I'm still at Brainley, like I dude, I've got a lot of time on my hands That's nice. I but you know that's why I like the consulting business.

Speaker 3
Like, but I also have like you, like I have other consulting clients and like Um but yeah, no totally. Uh yeah, I think one way or another it'd be good to stay in touch.

Pat Simmons
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I have a lot of even just bouncing ideas off each other, I have a lot of ideas. I think there's just It it's it's like an embarrassment of riches the amount of opportunities that are in in AI now. Um and I yeah, I I just It's just crazy. I don't even know. I'm like you thinking about okay, what's the higher highest leverage, highest ROI piece of business to go into? And I and I have some ideas. Um mainly like working with agencies because I I come from the agency world and I see all their problems and th those are most of my clients. Um and I think yeah you can make You can make a lot of money with just like helping a very specific industry or specific niche just like leverage AI. Just get like get their employees better, just 10x their their their kind of output.

Speaker 3
Totally. Well, that's a not like I've I have been thinking about how to leverage my network because the weird thing about working in a publisher is that everybody wants to work with you because you control the inventory. So like every ad tech vendor under the sun, like I've has like court because what I'm trying to say is I've I've developed like a super rich network of both like publishers, like people who own inventory and like all the intermediaries, but I don't know what to do with it. Because I don't because I don't want to be just like a hard driving like salesperson. Yeah. Um because I'm you know I I prefer the like operational side, but also like I do want to leverage all the relationships. You know what I mean? I do not have very many agency relationships because I'm not a salesperson. So my agency knowledge is lacking. Because I I I work with them, but I more I manage the person that works with them instead. Like I don't actually work with them very much. You know what I mean? Mm-hmm.

Pat Simmons
Yeah, yeah. I mean I wonder I mean if you're like if you're kinda gung ho about AI, I wonder if it's just like going to Just putting feelers out and being like, hey, I just I just uh you know helped build out the infar the AI infrastructure for this media company. Um do you want me to do something similar? Do you want me to consult with you and you just kinda feel out what their problems are and then just And see uh see I can get you know get clients that way.

Speaker 3
Wading into the Pat Simmons ecosphere. Yeah.

Pat Simmons
The eco sphere, dude.

Speaker 3
I'm bringing bringing in.

Pat Simmons
I'm like, come on in.

Speaker 3
I'm like, Yeah, yeah, I I I I I read your bio last night, uh your LinkedIn bio. Uh the the one that it's like um It's like uh you know it's like uh it's it's like uh it's like are you having are are you struggling with like are you afraid are you are you afraid of artificial intelligence are you afraid of artificial intelligence? I can help with that.

Pat Simmons
Just the it's the info the infomercial.

Speaker 3
I kind of I kind of kind of love it.

Langdon Miller
You know, you pretend it doesn't exist. Oh shit anywhere. I forgot about it.

Speaker 3
Like are you are you afraid of losing your job? Call me, Pat Simmons, to help you retain some Retain some semblance of pride. Post post post change.

Pat Simmons
Post revolution. Yeah, that's fucking funny. I honestly completely forgot I even wrote this. I don't even know when uh when I put this together. But yeah, this is uh yeah yeah pulling at the uh Pulling from the uh the the the copywriting, the uh the sales copywriter, direct mail copywriters.

Speaker 3
I do wanna I I I do wanna get more into I do wanna expand my consulting practice. Because the people that I've consulted for so far, they're they're gigantic jobs. Like the types of jobs that are like like gigantic projects, basically. Um I have not figured out the like you know, $2,000 a month, like just like you know, small size, medium, you know, whatever, just the the the like, you know, like five hours a week. I've not figured that out. I figured out the like 20 to 25 hour a week, like help us, and it's not Build a media company or help us like you know work in a you know reform the leafly business to include like retail media management and data and like a data broker, build the data broker business and blah Like this whole geese huge projects. Yeah. You know what I mean? I've I figure I've done those, but they're kind of like one-offs because I have a job already and I don't want to quit my job. Yeah. Like my career side. So I don't know.

Pat Simmons
Yeah, I have a lot I have a lot of thoughts. I um I know exactly what you mean. I've done the I've gone from the big projects to like the little, and really the key is Finding an audience finding like a specific type of perfect person with a specific problem and then just having like one solution for them. that is super templatized, that will work across any type of in uh uh whatever the niche is. Like it agencies again, as this example, like di media agencies, if I've worked with media agencies before. I offer one solution which is like lead generation. I do a lot of like lead gen stuff for them. So it's like every agency needs that needs that. And so it's literally just plug and play. It's I go to one client, I say, hey, I'll do exactly I'll get you 20 book calls on your calendar this month. I'll do exactly what I did for this other media agency. And then that way you're only spending That's where your time gets really leveraged because you're only spending a few few hours and you can outsource it and you can hire people and you can basically train people. And that's the that's the key. Like that's what I'm ultimately trying to get up get into. Um and um yeah, that's what I would recommend too, is just like think how you can templatize it because you ultimately don't want to Like you're you like your dad is a perfect example where it's like, yeah, you are ultimately selling your time, but how can you how can you like leverage other people's time?

Speaker 3
Totally. And you know, my dad famously would, I mean, honestly, like bill for, you know, 10 hours. He would do, he would work in these like big blocks. Or like even though he build for ten hours, he did not work ten hours. He worked probably three hours, but it was in such a way that Yeah, because he had done it so many times before that it like did not take very much time, but he knew that it was like worth a certain amount of money. Even though they wanted to charge by the hour, it was more of like a project fee versus a Whatever.

Pat Simmons
Yeah, value-based pricing, exactly. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Hell yeah, dude. Let's uh definitely definitely keep in touch. Yeah, let's catch up when you get back. When we both get back.

Speaker 4
Catch up in January. Perfect. Alright man, well thanks for thanks for the run.
